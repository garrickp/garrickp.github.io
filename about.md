## Garrick P.

I am a software developer with 14 years of experience writing C, Java, Perl, Python and Go code. I have served as a QA analyst, line coder, senior developer, development manager, technical architect, and a dozen other buzzword-laden roles which mostly boil down to designing, writing, and testing code. I am currently specializing in the Site Reliability Engineer role: designing and building out a suite of monitoring, deployment automation, and basically co-own the production environment of my current employer.

Please note that, as always, any opinions expressed on this site are solely my own, and in no way reflect the opinions of my employers or their associates.

## The Blog

This is going to be a rambling spot for the various discoveries I make while doing my daily job, as well as a smattering of my own personal opinions as I see fit to mention them. I hope to focus mostly on facts, but I accept that my personal biases will color the posts I make. I welcome discussion at garrickp [at] gmail [dot] com, until I can get comments set up here.

## The Theme

This site is currently themed with the [Poole](http://getpoole.com) Jekyll theme; the license can be seen [here](/poole-license).
